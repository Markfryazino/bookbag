# Icon Creation Instructions

This directory needs to contain the following icon files for the Chrome extension:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons in several ways:

### Option 1: Use an Online Icon Generator

1. Visit an online icon generator such as [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) or [IconKitchen](https://icon.kitchen/)
2. Create a simple icon with the letter "p" or a paper/document symbol
3. Download the icons in the required sizes
4. Rename them to match the required filenames

### Option 2: Use an Image Editor

1. Use an image editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or Figma
2. Create a 128x128 pixel canvas
3. Design a simple icon representing a document or paper
4. Export in the three required sizes

### Option 3: Quick Placeholder

If you need placeholder icons quickly, you can use a solid color square with the letter "p" in the center. Here are the recommended colors:

- Background: #4285f4 (Google Blue)
- Text: White

## Recommended Icon Design Elements

- Include elements that represent papers or documents
- Use colors that match the extension's theme (#4285f4 blue)
- Keep the design simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Make sure the icons are square (equal width and height)

Once you've created these icons and placed them in this directory, the extension will use them automatically.
